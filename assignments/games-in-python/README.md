## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Hangman Game

#### Description
Create the classic word-guessing game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. This task focuses on string manipulation, loops, and conditionals.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores initially (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _")
- Accept single letter guesses from the user
- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining (start with 6 attempts)
- Show current progress after each guess
- Display appropriate win/lose messages
- Ask if the player wants to play again

### 🛠️ Number Guessing Game

#### Description
Build a number guessing game where the computer picks a random number and the player tries to guess it with hints provided after each attempt.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Accept number guesses from the user
- Provide "too high" or "too low" hints after each incorrect guess
- Track the number of attempts taken
- Display a congratulatory message when the correct number is guessed
- Show the number of attempts it took to win
